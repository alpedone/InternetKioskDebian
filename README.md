# :computer: Internet Kiosk Debian Lenny

## 1. INTRODUCTION

In some places like schools, colleges, airports, malls, cafes, hotels, and many others, there is a demand to stay connected. With this demand comes the concept of Internet Kiosks.
The Internet Kiosk is a renowned security and stability Debian 5 Linux-based system, it is a lightweight, robust, high-security, modular, lockable system that offers complete security and anonymity to the user, and allows Internet access only using the free version of the Mozilla Firefox (Iceweasel) browser to browse the internet and eventually other applications. The system does not save browsing histories or passwords, as well as content control and high level of reliability, guaranteed by the latest security means.
In this project I will demonstrate how to prepare and customize the Debian 5 Linux Operating System, for use on publicly available computers, “Internet Kiosks”!

## 2. BACKGROUND

We know that today, in the Age of Smartphones, people are becoming more and more connected, yet there is still a good portion of the population who still cannot afford internet, mobile or fixed access or even have a phone or other device. that allows access to the internet.
In this scenario, it was thought to create a simple, robust and reliable operating system that would provide the ability to solve the connection needs of this population, being made available in public environments through internet kiosks!
Customization is largely about eliminating multiple packages and creating and including some scripts for controlling system routines and browsing, as well as adding some tools to ensure system stability and security.

## 3. OBJECTIVES

This project aims to bring a portion of the population closer to a service as essential as the Internet and the various services offered by it.
This access can be done through a custom Linux operating system and located at strategic points to function as an internet kiosk.
In addition to its functionality as an Internet Kiosk, this system can be used with advertising, warnings, still images (photos) and video streaming as application terminals and many other applications.
