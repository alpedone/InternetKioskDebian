This Project consists of customization through routine management scripts in the Debian 5 Linux Operating System, to be used as an Internet Kiosk, available to the general public.

The Internet Kiosk is a renowned security and stability Debian 5 Linux-based system, it is a lightweight, robust, high-security, modular, lockable system that offers complete security and anonymity to the user, and allows Internet access only using the free version of the Mozilla Firefox (Iceweasel) browser to browse the internet and eventually other applications. The system does not save browsing histories or passwords, as well as content control and high level of reliability, guaranteed by the latest security means.
In this project I will demonstrate how to prepare and customize the Debian 5 Linux Operating System, for use on publicly available computers, “Internet Kiosks”!
